        <h1 class="section-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the most common questions I receive about my graphic design services. If you don't find the answer you're looking for, feel free to reach out directly, and I'll be happy to assist you!</p>

        <h2>1. What kind of design services do you offer?</h2>
        <p>I offer a wide range of design services, including:</p>
        <ul class="core-page-ul">
            <li>Logo Design</li>
            <li>Brand Identity Development</li>
            <li>Website and App Design</li>
            <li>Marketing Collateral (brochures, flyers, etc.)</li>
            <li>Social Media Graphics</li>
            <li>Packaging Design</li>
            <li>Custom Illustrations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How do I get started on a project?</h2>
        <p>The process begins with an initial consultation where we discuss your needs, goals, and vision for the project. Afterward, I’ll send you a proposal that outlines the scope, timeline, and pricing. Once everything is agreed upon, we can kick off the creative process!</p>

        <h2>3. How long will it take to complete my project?</h2>
        <p>Project timelines vary depending on the complexity of the design and the scope of work. Generally, logo design projects can take 1-2 weeks, while larger projects such as full brand identities or website designs may take 4-6 weeks. I’ll always provide an estimated timeline before starting any work, and I’ll keep you updated along the way.</p>

        <h2>4. Do you offer revisions?</h2>
        <p>Yes! I believe in working closely with my clients to ensure they are completely satisfied with the final design. My process includes an initial concept, followed by revisions based on your feedback. I typically offer up to 2 rounds of revisions. Additional revisions may incur extra charges, but this will be discussed in advance.</p>

        <h2>5. What is your pricing structure?</h2>
        <p>Pricing varies based on the scope and complexity of the project. I offer competitive rates and will always provide a clear, transparent proposal before starting any work. If you're on a budget, feel free to discuss your requirements, and I will work with you to create a solution that fits your needs.</p>

        <h2>6. Do you work with clients outside of North Wales?</h2>
        <p>Yes! I work with clients worldwide. Thanks to modern communication tools like email, video calls, and project management platforms, working remotely is just as effective as in-person collaboration.</p>

        <h2>7. How can I pay for the services?</h2>
        <p>I accept payments via bank transfer, PayPal, and credit card. For larger projects, I usually ask for a deposit upfront, with the remaining balance due upon project completion.</p>

        <h2>8. Do you provide the source files for the final design?</h2>
        <p>Yes, once the project is completed and paid for, I provide you with the final files in multiple formats, including vector files (.AI, .EPS), and any other formats needed (e.g., .PNG, .JPG). These files can be used for print, digital, or other purposes.</p>

        <h2>9. Can you help with printing my designs?</h2>
        <p>While I don’t offer printing services directly, I can recommend trusted printing partners and ensure that your designs are ready for print. I’ll also guide you through the process to make sure everything looks great on the printed materials.</p>

        <h2>10. What if I need ongoing design support?</h2>
        <p>I offer ongoing design support for clients who need regular updates, marketing materials, or new designs over time. If you'd like to establish a long-term working relationship, let me know, and we can create a custom package tailored to your needs.</p>
