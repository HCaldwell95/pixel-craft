        <h1 class="section-heading">Collaboration</h1>
        <p>At <strong>PixelCraft</strong>, we believe in the power of collaboration. Whether you're a startup looking for a fresh brand identity, an established business in need of a design overhaul, or someone with a creative idea you want to bring to life — I am here to help turn your vision into reality.</p>
        <p>If you're ready to work together, here's how we can get started:</p>

        <h2>1. Initial Consultation</h2>
        <p>The first step in our collaboration is understanding your needs. Reach out to me via email or through the contact form, and let's set up a call or meeting. We’ll discuss your project, goals, timeline, and budget. This is where we can get to know each other and see if we’re the right fit for your project.</p>

        <h2>2. Creative Brief & Proposal</h2>
        <p>After our consultation, I'll send you a creative brief or questionnaire to capture all the necessary details about your project. Based on your answers, I’ll craft a tailored proposal with clear deliverables, timelines, and pricing. We’ll discuss this proposal and make sure everything aligns with your vision.</p>

        <h2>3. Design Process</h2>
        <p>Once we've agreed on the details, the creative process begins! I’ll start working on the design concepts, collaborating with you throughout the process to ensure we're heading in the right direction. I believe in open communication and feedback loops, so you’ll always be kept in the loop with progress and any necessary revisions.</p>

        <h2>4. Final Design & Handover</h2>
        <p>Once the design is finalized and approved, I will provide you with all the necessary files and assets in the required formats. Whether it's a logo, website design, print materials, or digital assets, I’ll make sure you have everything you need to use your new designs seamlessly.</p>

        <h2>5. Ongoing Support & Collaboration</h2>
        <p>I’m not just here for one-off projects — I’m available for ongoing support and collaboration. If you need adjustments, updates, or even a fresh project down the road, I’m always happy to work with you again.</p>
